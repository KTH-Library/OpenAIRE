OpenAIRE is an open science initiative, which supports the Open Access policy of the European Commission. This R package `OpenAIRE` provides access from within R to the OpenAIRE RESTful APIs, which are intended for metadata discovery and exploration only.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OpenAIRE like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KTH-Library/OpenAIRE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to retrieve data from the OpenAIRE search APIs:

```{r example}
library(OpenAIRE)

openaire("projects", page_size = 10) 

openaire("projects", params = api_params(
  size = 3, format = "tsv", proj_org = "Royal Institute of Technology")
) |> knitr::kable()

openaire("datasets", params = api_params(size = 1, format = "tsv")) |> 
  knitr::kable()

```

## Paging

A function provides crawling results, page by page:

```{r}

openaire_crawl("projects", params = api_params(
  size = 50,
  format = "tsv", 
  proj_country = "SE",
  proj_org = "Royal Institute of Technology")
)

```
